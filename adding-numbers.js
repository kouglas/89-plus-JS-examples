//subtracting works similarly 
//multiplying works similarly
//division works similiar using /
//incrementing works by adding one to value ie: myVar = myVar + 1 or myVar = myVar++
// decrementing works like incrementing using -
//use % to find remainder helps you determine if a number is even or odd
